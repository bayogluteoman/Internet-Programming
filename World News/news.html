Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series.All viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – evolve over time. When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit, which is normal for a virus. These changes are called “mutations”. A virus with one or more new mutations is referred to as a “variant” of the original virus.</p>

			<p>German Court Kills Berlin’s Radical Push to Limit Gentrification...</p>
			  <p class="read-more-target">BERLIN—One of the world’s most radical anti-gentrification experiments came to an end on Thursday after Germany’s constitutional court declared Berlin’s residential rent cap void.
             The decision ends months of uncertainty for property owners and renters. Berlin has some of the lowest residential rents of all European capitals but they have also risen very rapidly, nearly doubling over the past decade, persuading the left-wing local government to act last year.</p>
